##Abstract

Irreversibility is the enemy of engineers everywhere: it adds complexity and produces frictions
that slow down development. And if there is something that web developers hate, it is slowdowns!
At the same time we have to live with irreversible changes.
Is there any way to tame irreversibility?

Reversible processes are faster and easier to improve upon, and they are within reach of the average developer.
In this talk we will see how to take reversibility into account
to improve how we build and deploy software.
Along the way we will see many practical examples, among them:

* API design,
* continuous deployment,
* and decision making.
