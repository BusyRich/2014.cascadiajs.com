##Abstract

As developers we strive (although don't always succeed) to build software that people love to use— so why don't we build APIs that follow the same conventions? In this presentation we'll examine why current specs for APIs (mainly REST) are antiquated, problematic, needlessly complex, and eventually contribute to bad end-user experiences.

We'll finish with an examination and ideas on how APIs can become better by making them more Humanized (aka HAPI). We might even go so far as to propose that HTTP methods like DELETE and POST need to die— now do we have your attention?

Join us for what is likely to be a lively and heated discussion on the current and future state of web APIs as we know them.
