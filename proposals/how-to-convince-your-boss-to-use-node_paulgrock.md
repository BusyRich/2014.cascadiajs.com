##Abstract

You like JavaScript, right? Of course you do this is a JS conference. You'd probably like to spend more of your time writing it, right? Client side server side, doesn't matter where, does it? The real question is how do you convince your boss that JS everywhere is a good solution

This talk will give you a starting point for having that type of conversation with your team and boss. We'll cover general things that might surprise some members of your team, details shared by a number of large companies, why this type of transition is worth it, ways to make the change easier and answers to some of the questions that arose during those initial conversations.
