Between 2012 & 2014, for supplemental income while working on a startup, I 
taught about 400 people JavaScript. From 150 elementary school students to a roomful of Java engineers at GE,

switching over internally from another stack, a college student with CS chops that just came into your company, 
or a person you've been tasked with onboarding. Plus, ample motivation to volunteer to work with children!
