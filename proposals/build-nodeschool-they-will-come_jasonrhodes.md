## Abstract

I inexplicably decided to start my own [nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io) event in Baltimore after hearing about it on the [nodeup podcast](http://nodeup.com/fiftyfive). I had no relevant experience at all and no reason to believe it wouldn't end in a total disaster. Before I really knew what was happening, I had people across the country sending advice, local strangers offering up an amazing venue, and a ton of local interest and excitement for the event itself. 

Don't have any events in your area? What are you waiting for? If you're interested in what nodeschool is, some ideas about why it's popular, how to start your own event, or how to contribute to nodeschool in other ways, come hear a guy you've never heard of (that's me!) share what he's learned from getting [baltimore nodeschool](http://baltimorenodeschool.github.io) off the ground.
