##Abstract

Cylon.js [http://cylonjs.com](http://cylonjs.com) is a JavaScript framework for robotics based on Node.js that can communicate with many different kinds of hardware devices all at the same time. With surprisingly few lines of code, you can write apps that tie together Arduinos, ARDrones, Spheros, and more. The time has come for the next generation of open source robotics, and Cylon.js is here to help!
