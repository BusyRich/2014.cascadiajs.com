# Abstract

Many artists and designers are learning how to code, and this is a great
thing, but I want to teach coders a bit about the principles of visual
composition.  We'll use algorithms and functional programming to explore the
principles of line, shape, pattern, tone, balance, contrast, harmony and
variety to produce abstract pieces you can print.  I'll use svg and d3 for
the demos and code examples, but the principles apply to any technology.

I build software with various languages, make photographs and encaustic
paintings, build and noodle with synthesizers and brew delicious beer.
