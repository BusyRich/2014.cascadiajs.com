# The 55 Commits Syndrome

## Abstract

We all **like writing JavaScript**.  
We can be passionated, motivated and thrilled to help.  
We can spend minutes, hours or even days to contribute and build a project or a library.

No wonder why we would expect to see a one week effort *pull request* to be merged into the `master` branch.

So whose fault is it if we have worked in the open, produced a pretty code and fully covered unit tests? **Isn't it good enough to be merged**?

Certainly **not**.

Human beings are communicating and social animals. **Coding is *all* about communicating**.

This is a tale about a failed *pull request*, how to avoid the tunnel effect, how it finally got merged and why it made it to the *GitHub Explore* page.
