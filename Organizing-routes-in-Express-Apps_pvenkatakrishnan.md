##Abstract

If you are writing enterprise level express (nodejs) apps, your apps can quickly grow in leaps and bounds with multiple
routes. Route organization becomes a headache if we do not leash that animal in its earlier stages. Also if you have
forms which can result in  multiple crud operations, we may be able to get away by not deliberately wiring each of them
using ajax calls, on the front end. This presentation will walk through issues that we may run into while writing apps
for products in big companies and interesting ways to solve them and keep it under control.
Some of them include:

* Mounting sub apps to handle specific route/ route families.
* Using express-namespace / express-enrouten and similar modules.
* Using Express overridemethod() as a way to map a request from browser into a specific operation in the app.
