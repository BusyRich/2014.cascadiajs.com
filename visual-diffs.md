## Abstract

Testing CSS is hard. A human hand is required. But that doesn't mean that we can't use computers to help automate the process. We'll go over just what a visual diff is and how it can help to catch visual regressions before they get merged and deployed. We'll look at how to integrate them into a PR-based continuous integration deployment process, and some of the drawbacks of approaching UI testing in this way.

In another life Joe Lepper was an English teacher. But these days he's a software engineer happily working on the browser monitoring team at New Relic, helping to build tools to make it easier to gain visibility into how front-end applications function. He is passionate about JavaScript, object-oriented CSS, and front-end operations. Lately when he plays dressup he usually ends up as the horsey.
